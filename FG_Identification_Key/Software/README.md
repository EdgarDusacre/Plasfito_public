# Welcome to the R software created to analyze the data of OSPAR Monitoring samples. 

!!! All the data and methods are currently being submitted to a scientific journal. We will update this repository as soon as the article is published !!!

This software aims to focus on abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear.

We recommend using the latest version of Rstudio to run the different scripts.

## Process 
Open the Project_IDK.Rproj Rstudio environment 
Enter in the "R" folder 

1- Run Analysis_ALDFG_FTIR_ATR_sampling.Rmd 

2- Run Analysis_raw_data_OSPAR_sampling.Rmd

3-If you want more details on the Plasfito study area and the total length of the studied coastline, run the script Map_and_coastline_size.Rmd 

4-If you want more information on the efficient fishing activity and the fao catch and landings area in the studied area, run the script Maps_FE_and_fao_areas.Rmd 

5-If you want details on the width of the beached and the high tide coverage, run the script Width_beach_and_hightide_coverage.Rmd

## Data 
Raw data obtained in the field or the platform Global Fishing Watch are available in the folder "Datasheets"
